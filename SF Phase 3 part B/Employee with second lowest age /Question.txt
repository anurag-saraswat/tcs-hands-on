Create a file Employee.java (use right click option in the environment to create new file)

Create public class Employee with below attributes

Write constructor to initialize the attributes.

Try to compile the class with command:

Write a method employeeWithSecondLowestAge which takes array of Employee objects as input parameters and returns the Employee object with second lowest age.

Assume that no employee objects will have same age.

Declare main method in Solution class. Create array of four Employee objects.

Set age values for these array objects as 22,33,55 and 44, names as "aaa", "bbb", "ccc" and "ddd" and ids as 1,2,3 and 4 respectively.

Call employeeWithSecondLowestAge method from main method.
