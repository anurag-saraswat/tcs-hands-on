Create class Point with below attributes in file Point.java

double x

double y

This class represents a point in 2D system. Write constructor to initialize x and y attributes.

Write required getters and setters.

Compile this class with command javac Point.java

Create class Solution with main method in file Solution.java

Write a method findSequentialDistance in Solution class.

This method will take array of Point objects and find sequential distance from one point to next traversing all points.

E.g. if the points are (0,0) , (3,4) and (6,8) then the method will calculate distance from first point (0,0) to next i.e (3,4) (which is 5) and then from (3,4) to (6,8) which is again 5.

Hence, the total answer is 10. Same logic would apply for all points shared a sequence of array elements.

Create array of 4 Point objects assigning (x,y) values as:

-3,-4

0,0

4,3

16,-2

Call method findSequentialDistance passing this array as input.

Compile Solution class with command javac Solution.java and execute the same with command java Solution.

The resulted output will be 23.0
