Create a file Student.java, using touch Student.java

Create public class Student with below attributes

name String

double age

city String

Write constructor to initialize the attributes.

Try to compile the class with command:

javac Student.java

Create a Solution.java file, using touch Solution.java

Create public class Solution in that file.

Write a method studentCountWithSameCityAndAge which takes three Student objects as input parameters and returns the count of students with same city and age.

Consider the logic as below:
Method returns 3 if all students have same city and age.

Method returns 2 if two students have same city and age.

For any other combinition, method will return 0.

Declare main method in Solution class. Create three Student objects e1, e2 and e3.

Set below values (without using Scanner. Hence set hard coded values in main method itself):

e1 will have attributes "aaa",15,"mumbai"

e2 will have attributes "bbb",15,"mumbai"

e3 will have attributes "ccc",17,"mumbai"

Call studentCountWithSameCityAndAge method from main method.

Display the output of this method. It should be 2.

Compile the class using command javac Solution.java

Execute Solution class using command java Solution and test the output. Correct result should display "2".
