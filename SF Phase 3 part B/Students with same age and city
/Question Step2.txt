Next, set values as below (try using Scanner for practice. Hence you will experience using Scanner for String value.)

Set below values (try using Scanner for practice. Hence you will experience using Scanner for String value by calling nextLine() method in scanner object)

e1 will have attributes "aaa",15,"mumbai"

e2 will have attributes "bbb",15,"mumbai"

e3 will have attributes "ccc",15,"mumbai"

Compile the class using command javac Solution.java

Execute Solution class using command "java Solution" and test the output. Correct result should display "3".

Important note on Scanner:

Sometimes scanner does not read the new line character while invoking methods like nextInt(), nextDouble() etc.

Usually, this is not an issue, but this may be visible while calling nextLine() immediately after those methods.

Consider below input values:

22
hello
Referring below code:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int x = sc.nextInt();

String str = sc.nextLine(); -> here we expect str to have value "hello". Instead it may be "".

If above issue is observed, then it is suggested to add one more call to nextLine() after reading numeric value whenever next scanner call is for nextLine().

See the code below:

int x = sc.nextInt();sc.nextLine();

String str = sc.nextLine();

Try using this solution in case above issue is observed when you are using Scanner.
